WebSocket messages (AG-UI over `join {protocol:"agui/1"}`): `join`, `tool_result`,
`card_created`, `card_updated`, `card_deleted`, `context_updated`, `rollback`,
`nudge`, `set_business`.

### The relay's access rules

The socket holds every decision an organization has made, so none of these are
negotiable:

- **`join` requires `sessionToken`.** No token, or a token whose session cannot
  prove write access to `orgId`, and the relay sends an error and closes with
  1008. There is no anonymous read.
- **Identity is never taken from the client.** `payload.userId` is read only to
  be discarded; you act as the login on your session.
- **Membership** is a `memberships` row, or — when there is none yet, because
  the client connects before it loads the org graph — GitHub asked directly.
  Write access is what counts: a public repository hands `pull` to the entire
  internet, and `GET /repos` cannot tell a read-only collaborator from a
  stranger.
- **A created card is stamped with the sender the session proves.** You may
  route to anyone in the org, only ever as yourself.
- **Only the recipient** can decide, delete or undo a card, and a decision is
  attributed to whoever made it. Delegation is a new card, not a moved one.
- **`clear_store` does nothing.** It used to run `DELETE FROM cards` for the
  whole org, and the app sent it on every sign-out. It survives as a no-op so
  builds that still send it do not fail.

Rate limits (fixed windows in D1, keyed by session where there is one and by IP
where there is not; fails open): `/ai/route` 30/5min, `/oauth/github/token`
10/5min, `/connectors/*/sync` 6/5min, `/media` 20/hour.

### Scheduled

`crons = ["*/15 * * * *"]` syncs connectors for users who have a session, an org
and a configured connector, pushes anything new, and sweeps expired nonces and
stale rate-limit rows. Metered by the same per-message allowance a manual sync
uses.

### Phase 2 status (real identity & org)

Live-verified: `/health` 200, `/orgs/:owner/:repo/graph` returns 401 without a
valid session (auth guard), and `/ai/route` routes to real org members — an
invalid recipient guessed by the model is rejected and falls back to a real
member (`routingError: "AI picked an invalid recipient."`, `routedBy:"fallback"`).

Deferred: end-to-end `/orgs` against real GitHub needs the `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`/
`GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` secrets (a valid session comes from OAuth). Unit tests
cover the build+persist logic via `fetchMock`.

Phase 3 follow-up: the OpenAI `SYSTEM_PROMPT` still references demo members, so
the model may guess a demo id (caught by the validator and corrected via
fallback). Feed the real org members into the prompt so OpenAI picks them
directly.

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm test          # 273 tests under @cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers (real workerd)
npm run dev       # local wrangler dev
```

## Deploy / operate

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
npx wrangler d1 execute tiktokforwork --remote --file=./schema.sql   # apply schema
npx wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY        # set / rotate
npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
npx wrangler tail                              # live logs
```

### Secrets

| Secret | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | set | Enables OpenAI routing (`gpt-4o-mini`); without it, keyword fallback |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` | pending | From a GitHub OAuth App |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | pending | Stays server-side; never returned to the client |
| `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` / `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` / `VAPID_SUBJECT` | pending | Web Push. `node scripts/vapid-keys.mjs` prints a pair — [docs/notifications.md](../docs/notifications.md) |
| `MAILGUN_API_KEY` / `MAILGUN_DOMAIN` | pending | Email, the floor when no push reaches someone. `NOTIFY_EMAIL_FROM`, `MAILGUN_API_BASE`, `APP_WEB_URL` optional |

GitHub OAuth App: callback `tiktokforwork://oauth/callback`, homepage the base
URL above.

Optional env: `OPENAI_MODEL`, `GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI`, `GITHUB_OAUTH_SCOPE`
(default `repo`), `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` / `OPENROUTER_MODEL` (dev fallback).

## Composio (Gmail connector)

Verified live on 2026-08-10. The Worker talks to Composio over plain HTTPS; the
`composio` CLI is not usable from a deployed Worker (it authenticates with a
`composio login` session, not an API key).

| | |
|---|---|
| Base URL | `https://backend.composio.dev/api/v3` |
| Auth header | `x-api-key` |
| Key format | **`ak_…` (Project API key)**. Keys starting `ck_` are rejected 401 — they are not REST API keys. |
| Secret name | `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` |

**The key and the connection must live in the same Composio project.** A valid key
pointed at a project with no connection returns 200 with zero connected accounts,
which looks like success and behaves like failure.

### Connecting an account (this is how the in-app connect flow will work)

```
POST /v3/auth_configs
  { "toolkit": { "slug": "gmail" },
    "auth_config": { "type": "use_composio_managed_auth" } }
→ 201 { "auth_config": { "id": "ac_…" } }

POST /v3/connected_accounts/link
  { "user_id": "<our id for the person>", "auth_config_id": "ac_…" }
→ 201 { "redirect_url": "https://connect.composio.dev/link/lk_…",
        "connected_account_id": "ca_…", "expires_at": "…" }
```
The user opens `redirect_url`, authorizes, and the connection becomes ACTIVE under
that `user_id`. (`initiate()` is retired for Composio-managed OAuth since
2026-07-03; `link` is its replacement.)

Current state: auth config `ac_XcSzdgFl91Ds`, connection `ca_rISpkV_xpRVj`,
`user_id` **`tiktok-for-work-default`**, status ACTIVE. That `user_id` is what
`COMPOSIO_USER_ID` must be set to until per-user connections exist.

### Reading mail

```
POST /v3/tools/execute/GMAIL_FETCH_EMAILS
  { "user_id": "tiktok-for-work-default",
    "arguments": { "query": "newer_than:7d", "max_results": 10,
                   "verbose": false, "include_payload": false } }
```

Response (verified):

```
{ "successful": true, "error": null, "log_id": "…",
  "data": { "messages": [ … ], "nextPageToken": "…", "resultSizeEstimate": N } }
```

A message carries: `messageId`, `threadId`, `sender`, `to`, `subject`,
`messageTimestamp`, `labelIds`, `preview: { body, subject }`, plus
`messageText`/`payload`/`attachmentList` when verbose.

Composio's documented traps, all still worth coding against: the payload is
sometimes wrapped as `results[i].response.data.messages`; an empty `messages`
array is a valid no-matches result, not an error; and `verbose:true` /
`include_payload:true` can trigger 413 or truncation.

### Slack (verified 2026-08-10)

```
POST /v3/tools/execute/SLACK_SEARCH_MESSAGES
  { "user_id": "<per-user id>",
    "arguments": { "query": "to:me after:2026-08-03", "count": 10,
                   "sort": "timestamp", "sort_dir": "desc" } }
```

`to:me` is the modifier that means "addressed to or mentioning me" — confirmed
working; the tool's own docs list only `in:`/`from:`/`has:`, so this was pinned by
calling it rather than read from documentation.

Response: `{ successful: true, data: { ok, query, messages: { matches: [ … ] } } }`
— note the matches are nested under `messages.matches`, not `messages`.

A match carries: `text`, `username`, `user`, `channel`, `ts`, `permalink`, `iid`,
`team`, `score`, `attachments`.

Use **`permalink`** as the dedup `external_id`: it encodes channel + timestamp and
is stable. `iid` is a per-search result id and must not be trusted across calls.

### Notion (verified 2026-08-10)

Notion is the first **bidirectional** connector. Everything below was pinned by
running the tools live via the `composio` CLI against an ACTIVE Notion
connection — the same tool slugs and response shapes the Worker will see over
REST. Each area is tagged with how it was confirmed.

**Response nesting differs per tool.** `SEARCH`, `FETCH_DATABASE`,
`QUERY_DATABASE_WITH_FILTER` and `INSERT_ROW_DATABASE` all return their payload
directly under `data`. But `NOTION_LIST_USERS` nests it under
`data.response_data` — the same `results[i].response.…` wrapping trap the Gmail
section warns about. Parse defensively per tool.

#### Listing databases — `NOTION_SEARCH_NOTION_PAGE` — verified with a real call

```
POST /v3/tools/execute/NOTION_SEARCH_NOTION_PAGE
  { "user_id": "<per-user id>",
    "arguments": { "query": "", "page_size": 25,
                   "filter_value": "database", "filter_property": "object" } }
```

Response: `{ successful: true, data: { results: [ … ], has_more, next_cursor } }`.

Each result is a **database object**. For the picker we need two fields:

- **id** → `results[i].id` (a UUID).
- **human-readable title** → `results[i].title` — this is a **rich-text array,
  NOT a plain string**. The label is `results[i].title[].plain_text` joined
  (usually one segment). Do not read it off `properties`.

`filter_value:"database"` returns only databases (pages are excluded). An empty
`results` array is a valid "nothing shared with the integration" result, not an
error — Composio's own pitfalls list flags this. Only databases explicitly
shared with the Notion integration appear; in this test project exactly one did.

#### Reading one database's schema — `NOTION_FETCH_DATABASE` — verified with a real call

```
POST /v3/tools/execute/NOTION_FETCH_DATABASE
  { "user_id": "<id>", "arguments": { "database_id": "<uuid>" } }
```

Response `data` carries `title` (same rich-text array as above) and
`properties`: a **map keyed by property name**, each value
`{ id, name, type, <type-specific config> }`.

**Identifying the title property (the write target):** find the property whose
`type === "title"`. Every database has exactly one. Its Notion `id` is the
literal string `"title"` (not the property's display name — that name is
user-defined, e.g. `"Name"`). Match on `type`, not on name.

#### Inserting a row — `NOTION_INSERT_ROW_DATABASE` — VERIFIED by creating a real test row

This confirms the design doc's central bet: **writing only the title property
plus body content works on an arbitrary user schema.** A real row was created in
a test database whose columns we do not control, targeting only the title.

```
POST /v3/tools/execute/NOTION_INSERT_ROW_DATABASE
  { "user_id": "<id>",
    "arguments": {
      "database_id": "<uuid>",
      "properties": [
        { "name": "<title prop display name>", "type": "title", "value": "<card title>" }
      ],
      "child_blocks": [
        { "block_property": "heading_2", "content": "Summary" },
        { "block_property": "paragraph", "content": "…decision, who, when, source…" }
      ]
    } }
```

- `properties` is a **LIST of `{ name, type, value }` objects** (not a map). For
  the title-only write, one object with `type: "title"` and `name` = the title
  property's display name. `value` is a literal string (title/rich_text take
  plain text; select is a single option name; multi_select is comma-separated;
  date is ISO 8601; people wants comma-separated user UUIDs — see the tool
  schema's `value` description for the full per-type encoding).
- Body content is `child_blocks`: a list where each block is
  `{ block_property, content }`. `block_property` is the block type
  (`paragraph`, `heading_1/2/3`, `bulleted_list_item`, `quote`, `divider`, …);
  `content` supports inline markdown (`**bold**`, `[text](url)`). This is where
  summary / decision / actor / timestamp / source link go.

Response `data` is the created **page** object: the new row's id is `data.id`
(the same UUID a later query returns — usable as the dedup key immediately).

#### Querying rows with a filter — `NOTION_QUERY_DATABASE_WITH_FILTER` — verified with a real call

```
POST /v3/tools/execute/NOTION_QUERY_DATABASE_WITH_FILTER
  { "user_id": "<id>",
    "arguments": {
      "database_id": "<uuid>", "page_size": 100,
      "filter": { "property": "<prop name>", "<filter_type>": { "<condition>": <value> } }
    } }
```

Filter shape: `{ "property": "<name>", "<filter_type>": { "<condition>": <value> } }`
where `filter_type` matches the property's schema type
(`title`, `rich_text`, `select`, `status`, `date`, `people`, `checkbox`, …) and
must be exactly one key. Compound: `{ "and": [ … ] }` / `{ "or": [ … ] }`.
Select/status/multi_select option names are **case-sensitive** and must match
the schema exactly. `title` as a filter key always means the built-in title
column. (Round-tripped live: filtered on the title property and got the row back.)

Response: `{ successful: true, data: { results: [ … ], has_more, next_cursor } }`.
Each row is a **page object**:

- **page id (dedup key)** → `results[i].id`. Verified equal to the `data.id`
  returned by the insert above.
- **title** → `results[i].properties.<titleName>.title[].plain_text` (locate
  `<titleName>` the same way: the property whose `type === "title"`).
- Also present: `url`, `created_time`, `last_edited_time`, `parent`.

Paginate via `has_more` / `next_cursor` (pass the exact cursor string back as
`start_cursor`; non-UUID cursors may be rejected — a documented pitfall).

#### "Assigned to me" — CONCERN, contradicts the design doc's inbound assumption

The design doc's inbound ("rows assigned to that user arrive as cards") assumes
an "assigned to me" filter exists. **It is unreliable and schema-dependent —
treat this as a finding, not a solved problem:**

1. **There is no guaranteed assignee column.** "Assigned to me" requires a
   `people`-type property, which is arbitrary per database — the test database
   had **none**. A decisions database created by our own onboarding could add
   one, but a database the user picks may not have it, and its name is unknown.
   The `title`-only write bet holds precisely because assignee mapping does not.
2. **There is no clean "who am I".** `NOTION_GET_ABOUT_USER` is a *retrieve user
   by id* call — it **requires** a `user_id` and is not a "current user"
   endpoint. The integration authenticates as a **bot**, so there is no built-in
   human "me". Resolving "me" means listing users
   (`NOTION_LIST_USERS`, nested under `data.response_data.results`), picking the
   `type: "person"` entry, and taking its `id` — brittle when a workspace has
   more than one person.

Recommended path until real usage proves otherwise: for inbound, query the
configured database and run **every** row through the existing triage (the
design doc already says being in a database does not make something a decision),
rather than pre-filtering by an assignee that may not exist. If an assignee
filter is added later, resolve the person UUID once, confirm the target database
actually has a `people` property, and filter with
`{ "property": "<people prop>", "people": { "contains": "<user-uuid>" } }`.

### Auth configs (project-level, reused by every user)

- Gmail: `ac_XcSzdgFl91Ds`
- Slack: `ac_qv8jozIjt29D`
- Notion: `ac_qtoaZ6G__JEd`

One auth config per toolkit; each user gets their own connected account beneath
it, keyed by the Composio `user_id` we pass (the caller's numeric GitHub id).
