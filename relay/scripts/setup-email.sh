# One secret, a deploy, and a real round trip. It exists because setting the
# secret is the easy half: a wrong key, an unverified From domain and a
# recipient the shared sender may not reach all look identical from outside —
# nothing arrives — and the person who notices is otherwise whoever was
# waiting for a code that never came.
#
# So the last step actually asks the live Worker for a code and reports what
# Resend said. A refusal here is a minute's fix; the same refusal found later
# is someone locked out of the product.
#
# What this switches on:
#   * signing in with a six-digit code (POST /auth/otp/request, /verify) —
#     the only way in for anyone who does not have GitHub
#   * email as the notification floor, when no push channel reaches someone
#
# One API key from Resend, and nothing else: no domain, no DNS records, and a
# free tier that is a free tier rather than a trial — which is the right shape
# for a channel that is a fallback and a sign-in code rather than the product.
#
# Needs `npx wrangler login` and nothing else.
