#
# The connectors are written and tested; what they are missing is one secret.
# Without `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` the Tools screen says so out loud and every
# /connectors route answers 503, which is correct and is also indistinguishable
# from a key that is simply wrong. So this sets the key, deploys — the routes
# only exist in a deployed build — and then asks the live Worker to list the
# connectors, which is the first call that actually reaches Composio.
#
# What this switches on:
#   * Gmail   — mail addressed to you in the last week becomes decisions
#   * Slack   — messages addressed to or mentioning you, without opening Slack
#   * Notion  — rows in the database you point at, and decisions written back
#
# GitHub is not here: it is built in and needs no third party.
#
# Auth configs. Each connector ships the id of the one this project set up at
# Composio, so a fresh deployment works with no further configuration. An auth
# config belongs to whoever created it, so if you are running this against your
# own Composio account, create one per toolkit there and set:
#
#     CONNECTOR_AUTH_GMAIL, CONNECTOR_AUTH_SLACK, CONNECTOR_AUTH_NOTION
#
# This script offers that at the end. Skip it and the built-in ids stand.
#
# Needs `npx wrangler login` and nothing else.
