# The VAPID pair is generated here and piped into `wrangler secret put` without
# ever being printed, so the private key does not land in your terminal
# scrollback, your shell history, or a file. Anything you leave blank is
# skipped, so this is also the way to set one more secret later.
#
# What it does NOT do: the two GitHub repository secrets that let the deploy
# workflow run (CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN, CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID). Those live on
# GitHub, not Cloudflare — docs/setup-secrets.md, step 1.
