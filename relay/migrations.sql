/* Column additions for databases created before these columns existed.

   Every statement here is expected to fail on a database that schema.sql has
   already created from scratch, because schema.sql declares these columns
   inside CREATE TABLE. D1 aborts a file at its first error, so this file holds
   *only* ALTERs — nothing after them that needs to run. Anything that must run
   unconditionally belongs in schema.sql, which is idempotent by construction.

   The deploy applies this file statement by statement and tolerates
   "duplicate column name" for each, which is the already-applied signal. */
