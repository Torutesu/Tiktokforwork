// Outbound mail, for the person who has nothing else.
//
// Not everyone installs the app, and not every browser is asked to allow
// notifications. Email is the channel every account already has, so it is the
// floor: when no push channel reaches someone, the decision goes there. It is
// also what carries a sign-in code, which is the only way in for someone who
// does not have GitHub.
//
// Resend, and only Resend. One API key, no domain, no DNS records, and a free
// tier that is a free tier rather than a trial — which matters for a channel
// that is a fallback and a sign-in code rather than the product. One HTTP
// call; there is nothing here worth a dependency.
//
// (The *inbound* side — mail arriving as decisions, connectors/email.js — is
// still Mailgun's webhook, which is a separate feature with a separate secret
// and no bearing on sending.)

// Resend's shared sender: no domain, no DNS, and delivery only to the address
// that owns the Resend account. A real limit, and the difference between
// working in two minutes and working after a DNS change.
