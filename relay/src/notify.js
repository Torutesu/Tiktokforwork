// Tell the person a card is waiting on, wherever they are.
//
// One entry point, three channels. The relay, the cron and the email webhook
// used to call APNs directly, so a person without the iOS app — which today is
// everyone, because the client ships with push switched off — was told
// nothing. Now the hub looks at who the recipient is, what they read, and what
// can reach them:
//
//   APNs      every iPhone they registered
//   Web Push  every browser or installed PWA they subscribed
//   Email     when nothing above delivered, and they have an address
//
// The alert is composed once, in the recipient's language, and handed to each
// channel. Never throws and never blocks the caller: every call site defers
// this with waitUntil after the decision is stored and broadcast, on the rule
// that a notification that fails is a notification nobody got, not a decision
// nobody made.
