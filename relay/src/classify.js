// Which business a card is about, decided in the background.
//
// Nobody files anything by hand. Every card that reaches the relay, the sync
// or the email webhook without a business gets one here: the model reads the
// card, picks the business it belongs to from the ones the organization
// already has, or names a new one when nothing fits. The taxonomy is the
// residue of use — ten businesses emerge from the decisions about them.
//
// One model call, paid from the same allowance as the routing or triage that
// produced the card. Skipped when there is no model, and never able to break
// the card it is filing: a card without a business is a card, a card that
// could not be created is not.

const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You file a workplace Decision Card under the business it is about.

An organization runs several businesses (products, ventures, properties,
services). Given a card and the list of existing businesses, answer with the
ONE business the card belongs to.

- Prefer an existing business whenever the card plausibly concerns it.
- Only when none fits, name a new one: 1-3 words, the venture or product
  itself (e.g. "Hotel TikTok for Work", "Cafe Sakura", "SaaS Billing"), in the
  language the card is written in. Never a person, a task, or a department.
- Company-wide matters (hiring, finance, legal, the team itself) go under
  "General" — or the existing business that already plays that role.
