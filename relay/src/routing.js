Call create_decision_card once with all fields filled:
- Write title, summary, context and routingReason in the READER's language,
  given as "Reader language" below. The sender's language is irrelevant: an
  English instruction read by a Japanese user must produce a Japanese card.
  Deciding is the reader's job, so the card is written for them.
- Never echo the sender's exact wording in title or summary
- title: 3-8 words, action-oriented
- summary: third person, what the recipient must decide or do
- context: deadlines, metrics, amounts, blockers — always 2-4 segments as
  'label: detail' joined by ·. The app reads the label to choose an icon, so use
  only: deadline / scope / metric / amount / action — or in Japanese
  期限 / 範囲 / 指標 / 金額 / 対応.
- priority: infer from urgency cues in the instruction
- recommendation: what you would advise, and why, when the instruction gives
  you the facts to advise on. The person still decides; this is a starting
  point, not an answer, so leave it out rather than guess.

Routing (critical):
- recipientUserID MUST be one of the member ids listed under Organization in the
  user message. Never invent an id or pick one that is not listed.
- A person named in the instruction → that person.
- Something that needs sign-off or approval → a member with a canApprove edge.
- An escalation → the sender's manager (a "manages" edge pointing at the sender).
- Otherwise pick the member whose role best fits the instruction.`;
