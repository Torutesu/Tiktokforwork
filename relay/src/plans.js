//
// Which is exactly why every line of it has to be true. A price list is the
// one screen where a claim the code does not honour is not a rough edge, and
// there were two here: Pro advertised "Priority notification delivery", and
// nothing anywhere delivers a paying subscriber's notification differently —
// urgency is read off the card, never off the payer. And Business was priced,
// listed and selectable although nothing sells it. `available` marks the tiers
// a person can actually buy today.
